This is an Android version of the abstract paper-and-pencil game, Scribe, by Mark 
Steere. I haven't touched this project in years, but there appears to be an active
(as of January 2016) fork of it at https://github.com/TodorBalabanov/Scribe4 so you
might want to take a look at that.

Check out [Mark Steere's website](http://www.marksteeregames.com) for other 
implementations, including an actual Scribe board that you can print out. Like, 
on paper. I know, weird, right?

This app is [available in the Android Market](http://market.android.com/details?id=tyler.breisacher.scribe)

The icon is from [DeviantArt user sekkyumu](http://sekkyumu.deviantart.com/art/Developpers-Icons-63052312).

Thanks to Stack Overflow members AaronM and RaveDave for the [UpsideDownTextView](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2558257) and to Aaron Dalton's [SuperDuperGames](http://superdupergames.org/) which is where I first discovered the game.

Please feel free to fork, hack, submit bugs and suggestions, all that good stuff.
